# Implementing FTP using TCP and UDP with GUI
This project implements a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client and server using both TCP and UDP protocols in Java. It features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user-friendly interactions and incorporates Wireshark for analyzing network packets. The implementation supports essential FTP operations, ensures secure file transfers, and provides insights into protocol behavior through detailed packet inspection.

# Features
Protocol Support:
TCP: Reliable and error-checked communication.
UDP: Faster communication for lightweight file transfers.
Client GUI: User-friendly interface for FTP operations.
FTP Operations:
Upload files to the server.
Download files from the server.
List all available files.
Network Packet Analysis: Capture and analyze data packets using Wireshark.
Error Handling: Ensures secure and robust file transfers.

# System Requirements
Java JDK: Version 8 or later.
Wireshark: For packet analysis (optional).
Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS.

Enjoy secure, efficient, and user-friendly file transfers with this FTP implementation!
